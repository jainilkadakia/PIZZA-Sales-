# PIZZA-Sales-SQL Projects
The provided SQL queries offer comprehensive insights into the sales data of a 
pizza business stored in the "PZ_Sales" database. The queries analyze various 
aspects of sales performance, including total revenue, average order value, total 
quantity of pizzas sold, and more.

Starting with an overview, the first query calculates the total revenue generated 
from pizza sales by summing up the total price of each order. Subsequently, the 
average order value is determined by dividing the total revenue by the count of 
distinct order IDs. These initial analyses provide a macroscopic understanding 
of the business's financial performance.
Further queries delve into specific metrics such as total pizza quantity, count of 
distinct orders, and average orders per day. By grouping sales data based on 
order dates, both daily and monthly order counts are computed, shedding light 
on sales patterns over time.

Moreover, alongside these SQL analyses, a Power BI dashboard has been 
created to visualize and further analyze the sales data. The dashboard provides 
interactive visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and tables, to offer a userfriendly interface for exploring sales metrics and trends. By leveraging Power BI, stakeholders can gain deeper insights into sales performance and make 
informed business decisions more efficiently. This integration of SQL queries 
and Power BI dashboard enhances the analytical capabilities of the pizza 
business, enabling data-driven decision-making to drive growth and profitability.
